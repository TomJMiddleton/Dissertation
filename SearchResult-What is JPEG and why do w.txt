DOC TEXT: Companies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products. We do not ask a
royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in product literature (see the README file in the
distribution for details). We hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with
anything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability. The Independent JPEG Group is a
volunteer org...

DOC TEXT: If you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly
different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of
an intermediate color value. The trouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-
spatial-frequency color noise; and JPEG can't compress noise very well. The resulting JPEG file is
both larger and of low...

DOC TEXT: However, the disk space savings may justify converting anyway. This is a decision you'll
have to make for yourself. If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints. Be
prepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not convert well. [4]  How well
does JPEG compress images? Pretty darn well. Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have
handy, a 727x525 fu...

DOC TEXT: On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color image quality of all the
currently available Mac JPEG viewers. JPEGView can view large images in much less memory than other
Mac viewers; in fact, it's the only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a
typical 4MB Mac. Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down to fit on the screen,
rather than pres...
